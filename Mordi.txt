dawn davis stopped her red audi coupe along the curb on ewing street
the neighborhood was one of the oldest in the city  and the gentrification reflected early greek revival-style homes and a few  rare gothic revival residences
the neighborhood was ideal for a stroll on a warm late-summer evening with fireflies while the sun held off its setting well into the night
despite the safety of the neighborhood  dawn was nonetheless uneasy
she and sir had not met again  due to her business travels
sitting in her coupe  she was ready for more of sir
she relished her time with him   although the images of her in action during their previous meeting had caused a near fiasco with her son s friend
she loved how sir treated her  how he was in control  how she didn t have to make decisions
everything was out of her hands
it was a rarity
lack of control was foreign
yet  lingering fears of not managing a situation   particularly when sir was involved   had settled in her belly  weighing her down into the driver s seat
she wanted control or  at least  understand what was going on around her
she could then prepare
expectancy was bubbling deep in her stomach too
she recalled her shoulder-curling fears of the first meeting with sir  but those fears had been smothered by the nice downtown apartment
it wasn t a dump like she had honestly expected  even imagined
the apartment was quite the opposite
and  where she slipped off her pumps  there was the sign that read  daddy knows best
it was calming   as much as she could be calmed in such a circumstance
she now was excited to return to meet sir  so the apartment and message must have worked
this time  sir s invitation did not list the high-end downtown condo as the meeting place
the location was here  at this two-story house on ewing
ewing street altogether was another type of place than the downtown skyscraper   completely different
the apartment  where she had met him previously  was filled with bright sunlight from the wide windows and was swamped in poshness
it had only two rooms beyond the melded  open-air living room  dining room  and kitchen
the ewing house was a tudor style
it had decorative half-timbering  tall windows  patterned stonework  and a steeply pitched roof reminiscent of medieval english homes
the façade offered a dominant cross gable with a mini-gable-articulated door
it also had a tall  block chimney
an ancient oak shaded the yard and house  casting darkness over the place  blocking the light
dawn was reminded of green-faced witches  who lived in this style of house in children s books
looking through the passenger window of her car  she knew this house must have a basement
she imagined it as dark and damp  a musty smell
a dungeon
the house roused fears of the darker side of sex
chains  torture  imprisonment
ball gags
the gulag of bdsm
the place must have plenty of rooms and closets large and small to trap people
her foot accidentally hit the gas pedal  revving the powerful  v6 engine
her body was sharing a subconscious message  leave  avoid becoming a prisoner of sex  escape the labor camp before going in
yet she turned off the car
she puffed her cheeks  blowing out stress
then she gathered her few belongings into her purse
she stood beside the car and shuffled her skirt to her knees
you can do this
remember how much you liked it before  she encouraged
it ll be exactly the same  just somewhere else
the old-style front of the house put her further ill at ease
the doorbell gave three dongs in a deep arpeggio
the only missing pieces at the doorway were the crack of thunder and a streak of lightning slashing between heavy clouds
however  the evening was warm and in the last minutes before sunset
the evening smelled of cleanliness and peace of summertime
the door unlocked and was pulled back
greetings  ms
davis
sir grinned confidently
welcome
come in  please
she stepped into the cramped foyer
i m glad to see you again  sir  she said
she was proud to have remembered to add the title   his requirement
she slipped off her mauve high-heel slide sandals below a small sign that eased her worries once again   somewhat
it read  fathers are the earthly root of wisdom
have a seat  ms
davis
i have sauvignon blanc chilled
thank you  sir
she sat in a tufted barrel chair
she crossed her ankles and straightened her spine and stretched her neck to remain aloof and cool
however  she was feeling quite the opposite
she was wringing her hands in her lap
her heart skipped when the cork popped
all the memories of missteps and faux pas rushed back to her
inappropriate questions  forgetting to say  sir  being sent to the bedroom to repeat the rules aloud while facing the wall
sir appeared from around the corner to the living room
he was smiling
he held two wine glasses by their stems
she accepted a glass  thanking him
she sipped and remained silent but smiling
the condensation cooled her jittery hands nicely
sir eased into the matching barrel chair a few feet from her
he crossed his legs
i am glad you reached out again
i was unsure if you would  he said
sir resettled into his chair
i believe we connected previously
i enjoyed   loved   our time together  sir
you liked the images too
i was so glad to get them  sir
they were so unexpected  a special gift  they re my digital secrets  i ve looked at them and looked at them
our experience last time was so life-changing and enjoyable  it let me lose control  to not be in charge  i needed that  i have to remind myself that i don t have to have the reins all the time  sir
she stopped speaking abruptly  knowing she had blathered on
sir s eyes were studying her and he was letting her babble
when she had reined in her mouth  sir simply said   i am glad you enjoyed the images and our meeting
dawn smiled and darted her eyes downward
yes  sir
sir shifted slightly in his chair
he brought his wine glass to his lips
the first time with me is gentle  calming
i prefer it that way
he grinned like a loving father
my intent is for you to get to know me and for me to get to you know
we should know each other  she agreed  and added quickly   sir
his slow  knowing demeanor and tightened lips conveyed that he recognized dawn s near-misstep
he eased his mouth though
have a sip of wine  please
it will ease your stress
his voice was deep  and he spoke so smoothly
the sound comforted her
he was a loving father
he seemed to have that love and earthly wisdom that few people possess
she drank the cool sauvignon blanc  as if it would keep her mouth quiet and mind chilled
the two sat in silence for a moment
she looked at him
he wore casual tan linen pants and a fresh-print button-up
the design of the shirt was a blur of reds and yellows  the colors of heatwaves on a weather map
he was tanned
he still wore his gold bracelet that contrasted with his tan
he had strong hands and manicured fingernails
his home smelled of potpourri
there was a lingering scent of lime  rosemary  and vanilla
her chest raised as she inhaled the flavor
the mix further eased dawn s nerves
it diminished the fears of dampness and mustiness of a dungeon and brought forth crispness and innocence
after their quiet pause  dawn asked   is this your house  along with the apartment downtown
sir tsked his tongue and turned his head
have you forgotten one of my principle rules
she gasped
i am so sorry  sir
i just    i don t give grace after an initial meeting
my rules are simple enough that they should not be forgotten
consequences
dawn s voice cracked
the sudden jitter in her hands swished the wine to the rim of her glass
the legs of the wine slowly slid down the glass
she felt a warmth and a tightening at the base of her neck
ms
davis  sir said and paused  letting her name echo in the room and ring in her ears
yes  there are repercussions
i cannot let you do as you please
it would not be right
rules are important  central to what i do
by not requiring an action to rectify a mistake  you  in fact  are being disrespected
what do   she stopped herself immediately and put the wine glass against her lips
sir grinned with impishness
the contours of his face worried dawn
all the calming effects of the potpourri and the effects of wine disappeared like steam over boiling water
she became concerned about what sir would require of her as recompense for the infraction
last time  he had her standing in the corner  like a schoolgirl  repeating his rules aloud
but he had essentially said he was kinder last time
how unkind would he be in this meeting
the images of a dungeon in the basement roused her mind
have you been out with anyone lately
he asked
the simple  off-topic question surprised dawn  because she expected her punishment to be meted out immediately
she fumbled her answer
yes  i had dinner with a man from another firm  sir
only dinner
nothing more
dinner with a competitor
that is intriguing
may cause a dust-up
he then became silent and only studied her
dawn was unsure if  or how  she should answer
the tension heightened between them
her eyes moved around the room
the dark wood support beams were bare along the peaked ceiling
he had fashioned the interior in light  warm colors to highlight those beams
a single window was behind her and was covered by a heavy curtain
the fireplace was built of heavy  dark stones with a cast mantel
the wood inside the fireplace was charred but hadn t been used since winter
a chandelier overhead was wrought-iron barn metal and formed in a castile style
it had two tiers spiked with wax candles
none were lit currently  but they obviously had been lit before
to dawn  the chandelier matched the notion of a dungeon
does he have these chandeliers in each of his places
there was one in the apartment  which seemed out of place
her mind brought up images of people chained to it  black masks over their head  arms handcuffed
she could not take her eyes off the light fixture
sir recognized her upward stare
the chandelier is nearly a hundred years old  he said
it hanged in a medieval castle in england
i saw it and purchased it immediately
dawn nodded
she took a drink
to her  an ancient chandelier from a castle demanded the presence of a dungeon
there had to be one somewhere
together  the pair generated fear and conjured apprehension about the unseen and the what-could-be or the what-already-is
her foot tapped the floor
all she wanted was to know her punishment for the misstep
knowing  she could prepare herself  stead her mind
when her thoughts returned  sir was waiting for her
he was sitting still and wore a wry grin
welcome back  he said
does the chandelier bother you
dawn tried to smile lightheartedly
no  sir  but our meeting is still   still has me nervous
i think of all these bad things happening
i apologize  sir
bad things
what  bad  would i do
sir asked
ball gags  coarse ropes  latex hoods
oh god
spreader bars
she shivered    sir
sir grinned jovially   more jovially than dawn had seen before
she began to  worry   a speeding heart and pump of perspiration along her hairline
she drummed up a reason to leave suddenly
i have all of those items you mentioned  but  understand  distance makes what we fear even larger than it is  sir said slowly  almost threateningly
would you want a tour
sir  i believe i have a meeting with a client about a bridge project
i m sorry  but i have    ms
davis  he said harshly
i am not here to torture you or beat you
this is only about release your release from the pressure you yoke to yourself
change your thinking
have another sip of wine
we can have a walk to acquaint yourself with my home
sir stood
he reached out his hand to dawn
come with me  my darling
you re safe
you will always be safe with me
dawn set down her glass and took his hand
he raised her up
when she stood  her knees were wobbly  and a shot of pressure zoomed up her spine
he and dawn passed through a round-top doorway beside the fireplace
the hallway was dark
the left side was a wall of stone  which was the rear side of the fireplace
the opposite wall of the hallway was lined with dark wood
they came to the first wooden door
sir grabbed the handle and pushed the door open
inside was a lone child-size bed with majestic head- and footboards and covered in pink princess bedding and blanket
sir opened another door to a room
dawn saw a single dull  metal pole in the center of the room
it was bolted to the ceiling and the floor
there were two iron rings welded high on the piece
the hall had two more rooms
one room had a single wooden chair in the center of the room  and the other had a long unpadded masseuse table
when sir opened the door at the end of the hallway  she got scared
it was a stairway down to  of all places  the basement
she suddenly stopped and tried to tug her hand away
i can t
i think i need to leave
i m sorry  sir
sir denied her departure
trust me
i am not here to torture you
she gave it
with each step down  dawn became more nervous and jittery
feeling her remaining hesitance  he stopped on the stairway
do i look like a torturer
dawn stiffened  standing a foot taller than him because she was two steps higher
i want to show you the good things
i trust you will enjoy yourself if only to realize how wrong you are in your fears
her mouth gave a wince and half-smile at once
downstairs  sir led dawn with a gentle tug on her hand when she slowed
dawn nibbled on her fingernails on her right hand
the ceiling was low  and the support beams for the first floor were visible  crossing the hallway horizontally
the floor was a dull concrete
the concrete was not smooth  like a sidewalk  but was rough
they passed four doors before sir stopped
he grabbed the small door handle on a flimsy wooden door
this  my dear  is for you
he pushed open the door
the color of the room was rich  red velvet because of the soft carpet  heavy curtains  and the painted ceiling
in the center of the room was a grand chair
it was a matching red
she turned to sir
the chair reminds me of mick jagger
you know  the rolling stones s lips and tongue logo
he smiled
go inside
the carpet was spongy and soft
her toes seemed to be walking on marshmallows
have a seat  he said
she pressed her hand into the cushion
the chair was plush and velvety
she glanced back at sir  who was leaning calmly against the door frame
dawn turned to sit  but sir stopped her
naked  ms
davis  he sing-songed
the lovely woman undid the buttons and shed her blouse
she loosened the zipper on her skirt and let it slip to the carpet
she then started to sit
sir corrected her
ms
davis  all the way
oh  sorry  sir
she unclasped her bra and then shimmied her panties down her thick thighs
she stood naked in the red room
the red light cast shadows over her body s creases and curves
now  please  sit
she settled into the chair
the fabric rubbed softly against her butt  elbows  hands  and her calves
she saw sir step onto the carpet and come to the chair
he lifted her hand  as if he was about to slide on a wedding band  and set her hand on a cool  polyester armrest
he then secured her wrist with a leathery band
feel okay
he asked
dawn only nodded  fear nearing once again  but she remained in control of her fears
sir suddenly tightened the band
she felt the pulsations in her wrist  as it cut down circulation
he secured her other wrist as tight
then he tucked a tress of her hair behind her ear
do not worry
you are safe with me  he said
he rubbed the back of his hand down her cheek
he took each ankle and secured them individually
she felt pulses at four points of her body  as well as her chest and her temples
she was comfortable but constrained
sir knelt beside the chair
he patted her forearm
then he cranked a bar  which was on the side of the chair
it raised the lower portion of the chair
soon her ankles were higher than her head
next  sir further adjusted the lower portion of the chair  so her legs were spread
he smiled down into her eyes  as he strapped down her thighs
the band squished into their fleshy thickness
the tightness caused a sharp streak of pain
you are mine  my darling  sir said
he slid his hand down her left thigh
at her hip  he moved right and guided his fingers through her bush
she jolted as he grazed her pussy
that lightest touch brought her body close to orgasm already
in all her fears and sir s constant surprises  she had forgotten how sexually primed she was
sir  please  i need you  she said
i have wanted you for weeks
i haven t been with anyone else
i have been waiting for you
he paused his constrictions briefly
i trusted that was so
i am the one providing you with peace and relief
no one else is doing that for you
he reached over her  brushing her breast  and pulled over a strap
its roughness felt like a seat belt in a car
there was a metallic clack as it locked across her upper chest
her breasts were squished  making her nipples jut out
her ankles  thighs and wrists were strapped to the chair
she inhaled as much air as the belt over her chest would allow
sir  keep me safe  she whimpered
make sure i m  she didn t finish
yes  darling
i always think of you first
he drew his fingernail through the center of her chest and to her deep bellybutton
she giggled and twisted
he moved his finger lower
it stroked her brown hair
he brought his finger as close to her clit as possible without touching it
dawn began to beg
please  sir  put it in me
i can t wait much longer
you will wait  ms
davis
i am not ready
you are not ready
feel me
you ll know i m ready for you
i ve waited so long
i ve been faithful  intent  sir
he dragged his finger out of her bush  over her belly and circled her brown nipple
she caressed the flesh being squeezed by the belt
he roughly massaged her nipple
then he leaned forward and nibbled on it
she exhaled when his lips covered this part of her body
raising up to look at her  his warm breath was sensuous on her skin
he leaned down again and suckled her other nipple
unexpectedly  she jolted as his finger fondled her pussy
she hadn t noticed its slow move downward with everything else happening
the restraints and belts holding her down no longer mattered to her
sir s sexual attention overrode the throbbing pulsations and concerns about her bonds
her mind was ferried to a different plane caught between pain  desire  and pleasure
goodness encircled her
she was sitting in  laying on  strapped to that same goodness
then  there was the onset of orgasm  a flood of sweetness  distant though it was
dawn watched sir moved to her feet
he touched her knees
he kneaded her thighs above the straps
when was the last time you had a face in your cunt
sir asked
she answered in a gasp
long time  sir
did you enjoy it
she nodded
her face scrunched in a mix of emotions
have you wished it would happen again
she nodded  biting her bottom lip
he reached back and grabbed her feet
he pressed his thumbs into the arch of her feet
i get the feeling that you prefer a large cock over a fast tongue
she dug her teeth into her lips
she said nothing
i would ask what you prefer  but you re in no position to answer
you get what you get
she remained silent but biting
you might need a smack on your face with a hard dick
he strode from her feet to her face
his hand gripped the length hidden beneath his clothing
she darted her eyes between his masculine façade to his manliness
she had not seen his dick since it was last in her mouth
and that seemed to her years ago
her fingers scrunched into fists
please  sir
just something
i need something
please
very polite  my darling  saying  please
he turned her head aside and patted her cheek
he loosened his pants
she gasped when the light fabric dropped to the floor
before her  level with her eyes  was the bulbous head of his penis the penis she had been waiting to feel
she swallowed the pooling saliva in her mouth
she flicked her tongue  like wooing the erection closer
he shifted forward and let its tip touch her tongue
she flicked faster and began to lap to draw it closer
finally  he pushed into her mouth
her cheek bulged out as he drove hard
he pulled out of her mouth
his dick was drizzled with dawn s spit  some of the saliva dangling off the length
he gave her a quick pop on her cheek
he moved to the end of the chair
he situated himself between her legs
her face brightened in anticipation
he had not fucked her yet
at their first meeting  he had already determined it was too soon
this  their second meeting  his cock was aligned with her cunt
she was too excited
a quick touch and her body would break into orgasmic goodness
he eased himself in  but she was so slick and waiting that his dick pushed deep  forcing her to grunt
he rocked back and forth  and in seconds  she had lapsed into pleasure
their slipperiness made the sex easy and subtle
dawn tightened herself for sir s sake
she wanted to bring him to the ecstasy that she had already entered
dawn watched his body tense with the thrusts
his shoulders pulled back  broadening his chest
the speed of the thrust increased  and his muscles constricted to her delight
finally he pulled out and shot his cum over her belly
he rushed around her and touched the last drool of cum from the tip of his dick onto her outstretched tongue
she brought in her tongue to lavish the goo
as he propped himself up against the wall  she enjoyed the waves of pleasure splash over her  as well as basking in the mental joy of making this man cum with the visual proof all over her belly
even more  the subtle aftertaste remained on her tongue
later  the garage door raised  and the shiny red coupe pulled inside
dawn set down her purse and tote bag on the kitchen table
she noticed the package in the middle of the couch
she rushed over to it
i can t believe it arrived already
she shoved her fingers into to hole to rip open the package but paused
she first called   brandon
brandon  are you here
she heard no answer  so she tore open the package
